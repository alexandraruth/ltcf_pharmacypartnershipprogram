# Exploring implementation of the Federal Pharmacy Partnership Program for COVID-19 Long-Term Care Facility Vaccination in skilled nursing facilities in the U.S.

## Description

This study combined numerous complex data sources pertaining to state-level skilled nursing facility networks, pharmacy networks, and Covid-19 transmission in facilities and counties during Nov. 2020 to assess implementation features of a major federal program to reach long-term care facilities (LTCFs) with vaccines in December 2020-January 2021.

## Research questions

+ What factors were associated with state-level uptake of the pharmacy partnership program?
+ What was the reach of the program based upon CVS and Walgreen's 75-mile distance criterion with respect to nursing homes that were hardest-hit by Covid?


### Data sources (more details & codebook coming soon...)

+ CMS COVID-19 Nursing home dataset
+ Hayes' Directories database of community pharmacies
+ National Center for Health Statistics Urban-rural continuum codes 
+ New York Times Covid case data (county-level)
